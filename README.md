Hey ðŸ‘‹, 

Ever thought about what happens to your plants if you move to a new city and donâ€™t know what to grow, or if you simply donâ€™t have time to take care of them? or Have you ever thought what happens to the mass tree plantation done by Govenrments and NGOâ€™s? Statistics says a large portion of plants die due lack of care towards them.
